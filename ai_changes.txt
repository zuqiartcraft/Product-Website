ZuqiArt&Crafts Website - AI Implementation Summary

Date: October 19, 2025
Updated: Secure API-based authentication implemented

Database Setup
Created Supabase database structure:
- Table: products with fields: id (UUID), name, short_description, long_description, size, image_url, price, is_active, created_at, updated_at
- Added indexes for better query performance on is_active and created_at fields

Environment Variables Required
Create a .env.local file with:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (your Supabase project URL - PUBLIC)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (your Supabase anon key - PUBLIC)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (your Supabase service role key - SECRET!)
- ADMIN_USERNAME (admin login username - SECRET, server-side only)
- ADMIN_PASSWORD (admin login password - SECRET, server-side only)
- ADMIN_SECRET (random string for token generation - SECRET)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_BUCKET (storage bucket name)
- WHATSAPP_URL (WhatsApp chat URL)
- GOOGLE_PAY_QR_URL (Google Pay QR code image)
- GOOGLE_PAY_PHONE_NUMBER (UPI number)
- BANK_NAME, BANK_ACCOUNT_HOLDER_NAME, BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER, BANK_IFSC_CODE

Main Application Features
1. Home Page - Product listing with modern grid layout, pagination, search bar, dark/light mode toggle
2. Product Detail Page - Full product info, Buy Now and WhatsApp buttons
3. Header Component - Business name as logo, search functionality, theme toggle

Admin Application Features
1. Admin Login Page - Secure server-side authentication with env credentials
2. Admin Dashboard - Product management table with CRUD operations
3. Product Form - Add/edit products with image upload and URL support

Security Implementation
- Admin login uses secure API routes (/api/admin/login)
- Admin credentials stored server-side (NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC)
- All database write operations go through authenticated API routes
- Service role key used server-side to bypass RLS for admin operations
- Token-based session management with 24-hour expiry
- API Routes: /api/admin/login (POST), /api/admin/products (GET/POST), /api/admin/products/[id] (PUT/DELETE/PATCH)

RLS Policies
Enable RLS: ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
Public can only view active products: CREATE POLICY "Public can view active products" ON products FOR SELECT TO public USING (is_active = true);

Security Benefits
- Anon key is public but can only read active products
- No one can write/modify data without valid admin token
- Admin credentials never exposed to browser
- Service role key stays on server
- Token expires after 24 hours

Image Upload & Multiple Images Feature
- Multiple images per product with carousel display
- Admin can upload images directly to Supabase Storage OR provide URLs
- Image carousel with left/right arrows and dots indicator
- Reorder images in admin form (marked as Main for first image)
- Storage: images stored in Supabase Storage bucket (product-bucket)
- Database: image_url column stores JSON array ["url1", "url2"]
- API Route: /api/admin/upload (POST with multipart/form-data)
- Limits: 5MB per image, supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Helper function: getProductImages() to parse old and new format

UI/UX Improvements
- Toast notifications: Replaced alert() with elegant toast messages (green success, red error, blue info)
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds with manual close option
- Modal improvements: Fixed scrolling, title stays fixed, content scrolls independently
- Modal properly sized with max-height (90vh)
- Image support: Supabase, Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3 (all regions), Azure CDN, AWS CloudFront, Cloudinary, Imgur

Payment Flow Implementation
- Buy Now button opens multi-step payment modal
- Step 1: Payment method selection (Google Pay, Bank Transfer)
- Step 2: Payment details (QR code for Google Pay, bank details for Bank Transfer)
- Step 3: Confirmation screen with buyer information form
  * Collects buyer name and delivery address
  * WhatsApp button disabled until both fields filled
  * Pre-formatted message includes: product name, ID, amount, buyer name, buyer address, transaction ID placeholder
  * Note to attach transaction screenshot
- Navigation buttons (Back/Next) between steps
- Note displayed: Payment gateways to be implemented soon and verification message

Admin Panel Enhancements
- Search bar to filter products by name or ID
- Product ID column added to admin table (truncated display with full ID on hover)
- Search functionality works in real-time
- Shows "No products found" message when search has no results

File Structure
- src/app/ - Main application pages (home, product detail)
- src/admin/ - Admin components and contexts (separated for easy identification)
- src/components/ - Reusable UI components (Header, ProductCard, Pagination, ThemeToggle, ImageCarousel, Toast, PaymentModal)
- src/contexts/ - React contexts (ThemeContext)
- src/lib/ - Utility libraries (supabase, supabase-admin, auth)
- src/types/ - TypeScript type definitions
- src/hooks/ - Custom React hooks (useToast)
- src/app/api/admin/ - API routes for authentication and product management

Notes
- No database migration files created (manual SQL setup only)
- User authentication not implemented
- Admin links not shown on main app
- WhatsApp button redirects to env-configured URL (NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_URL)
- Buy Now opens multi-step payment modal
- Dark/light mode fully functional with persistent storage
- Payment flow includes Google Pay/UPI and Bank Transfer options
- Users share payment proof via WhatsApp after payment
