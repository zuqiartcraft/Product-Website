## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Started
1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Run the SQL schema provided to create the `products` table
3. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Access the admin panel at http://localhost:3000/admin
7. Add your products through the admin dashboard
8. Products will appear on the main page at http://localhost:3000

## ✨ Features Implemented
✅ Product listing with pagination
✅ Product detail page
✅ Admin authentication
✅ Admin product management (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Enable/Disable)
✅ Dark/Light mode toggle
✅ Responsive design
✅ Modern UI based on reference images
✅ WhatsApp integration button
✅ Buy Now button (placeholder for future implementation)

## 🔒 Security Implementation (UPDATED)
**Server-Side Authentication:**
- Admin login now uses secure API routes (`/api/admin/login`)
- Admin credentials stored server-side (NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC)
- All database write operations go through authenticated API routes
- Service role key used server-side to bypass RLS for admin operations
- Token-based session management with 24-hour expiry

**API Routes Created:**
- `/api/admin/login` - POST: Authenticate admin credentials
- `/api/admin/products` - GET: Fetch all products (admin), POST: Create product
- `/api/admin/products/[id]` - PUT: Update, DELETE: Delete, PATCH: Toggle status

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public can only view active products
CREATE POLICY "Public can view active products"
ON products FOR SELECT TO public
USING (is_active = true);
```

**Security Benefits:**
✅ Anon key is public but can only read active products
✅ No one can write/modify data without valid admin token
✅ Admin credentials never exposed to browser
✅ Service role key stays on server
✅ Token expires after 24 hours

## 📝 Notes
- Admin code is separated in the `src/admin/` directory for easy identification
- No database migration files created as requested - manual SQL setup only
- User authentication not implemented as requested
- Admin links not shown on main app
- WhatsApp button opens WhatsApp with product name in message
- Buy Now button shows alert (to be implemented later)
- **Security is now production-ready with server-side authentication**

## 📸 Image Upload & Multiple Images Feature (Added)
**What's New:**
- Products can now have multiple images displayed in a carousel
- Admin can upload images directly to Supabase Storage OR provide URLs
- Image carousel with left/right arrows and dots indicator
- Reorder images by dragging them left/right in admin form
- First image is marked as "Main" image
- Image counter shows current/total (e.g., "1 / 3")

**Technical Details:**
- `image_url` column now stores JSON array: `["url1", "url2", "url3"]`
- Upload API: `/api/admin/upload` (POST with multipart/form-data)
- Storage bucket: `product-bucket` (public read access)
- Max file size: 5MB per image
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Components: `ImageCarousel` for display, updated `ProductForm` for management
- Helper function: `getProductImages()` to parse old and new format

**Environment Variable to Add:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_BUCKET=product-bucket
```
